# LYTE Lessons
This repo contains the materials and documents created for my lesson series on web development for the LYTE Program at Thomas A. Edison Charter School in Wilmington, DE. Each day's lesson materials are stored in a folder and are organized by day. Each day's lesson is a rudimentary introduction to one of the three main web development languages. Day 1 focues on HTML, Day 2 focuses on CSS, and Day 3 focuses on Javascript. The lesson materials for Day 3 have not been created yet.

I fully encourage and endorse anyone to use these materials to teach their own lessons on web development. The original audience was middle schoolers with no prior programming experience. However, I believe that these lessons would be a good introduction to just about anybody who has never written code before.
